    <h1>1. Spring Web</h1>
Spring Web is a module in Spring Boot that helps to build web applications.<br>
It allows you to create APIs, handle requests of client (GET, POST, etc.), and send JSON responses.<br>
It helps to create REST APIs using Spring MVC.<br>
It uses DispatcherServlet as the front controller.<br>
It contains annotations like:<br>
<pre>
•	@RestController
•	@GetMapping
•	@PostMapping
•	@RequestBody
•	@PathVariable
</pre>
<h1>2. MySQL Driver</h1>
MySQL driver is a small software that helps Spring Boot connect to the MySQL database.<br>
When you add this dependency:<br>
<pre>mysql-connector-j
Spring Boot understands how to:
•	connect to MySQL
•	run queries
•	read and write data
•	</pre>
<h1>3. Spring Data JPA</h1>

Spring Data JPA helps you interact with the database easily without writing long SQL queries.
It automatically handles CRUD operations.<br>
Spring Data JPA follows the Repository Pattern and reduces boilerplate code.
<pre>Example:
findByEmail() → Spring creates query:
SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = ?
</pre>
It uses Hibernate internally.
<h1>4. Lombok</h1>

Lombok is a tool that reduces boilerplate code like getters, setters, constructors, toString etc.
<h1>5. ORM (Object Relational Mapping) </h1>

ORM is a technique that maps Java classes to database tables. Or ORM is a concept in which java class connect to the database table.
<h1>6. ORM Tool</h1>

Tools that implement ORM concept are called ORM tools.<br>
Example: Hibernate.
<h1>7. Hibernate</h1>

<pre>Hibernate is the most popular ORM tool.
It maps Java objects to database tables and handles queries automatically.
It handles:
•	table creation
•	data saving
•	queries
•	relationships (OneToMany, ManyToOne, etc.)
•	caching
</pre>
<h1>8. Entity</h1>

An Entity is a Java class that represents a table in the database.<br>
Entity class contains @Id which is used as primary key.
<h1>9. Controller</h1>

Controller receives the request from the user and returns a response.<br>
It is the entry point for APIs.
<h1>10. Service</h1>

Service contains business logic.<br>
It handles calculations, processing and main operations.
<h1>11. Repository</h1>

<pre>Repository interacts with the database.
It performs CRUD operations using JPA.
•  save()
•  findAll()
•  findById()
•  delete()
Repository extends JpaRepository or CrudRepository.
pring creates runtime proxy using JDK Dynamic Proxy or CGLIB.
</pre>
<h1>12. IOC (Inversion of Control) </h1>

IOC means instead of you creating objects, Spring creates and manages objects.<br>
IoC means Spring controls the creation of objects instead of you creating them with new.
<h1>13. Dependency Injection (DI) </h1>

DI is a technique where Spring provides the required object to another object automatically.<br>
Dependency Injection means Spring provides required objects (dependencies) to your class automatically.
<h1>14. Constructor Injection</h1>

Constructor injection means Spring puts (injects) dependencies through the constructor of the class.

<b><pre>Why interface in repository
All others layers contain real code and logic, so they must be classes.
Repository is an interface because Spring Data JPA auto-generates the entire implementation and CRUD methods.
There is no need to write logic in repository Spring Data JPA  automatically create   save ,find ,update,  delete.
Why repository is interface?  Because interface allows Spring to create proxy classes at runtime.
